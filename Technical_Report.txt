                    AgriAI Integrated System - Technical Report
================================================================================

1. OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AgriAI is a unified, intelligent web application designed to assist farmers and 
agricultural professionals in making data-driven decisions. The core functionality
is the "Smart Crop Suggestion" system, which recommends the most optimal crop 
to plant based on environmental and soil metrics.

2. TECHNICAL STACK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The application is built on a modern, decoupled architecture using entirely 
Python-based technologies:

- Frontend Framework: Streamlit
  Reasoning: Selected for its rapid development capabilities and native Python 
  integration. It allows for the creation of beautiful, interactive, and data-
  centric user interfaces, significantly reducing the complexity of the codebase.

- Machine Learning Library: scikit-learn
  Reasoning: The industry standard for classical machine learning, providing 
  efficient tools for predictive data analysis, model pipelines, and preprocessing.

- Data Manipulation: Pandas & NumPy
  Reasoning: Essential for handling, cleaning, and formatting the dataset during 
  both training and real-time inference.

- External APIs: Wikimedia API & Python `requests`
  Reasoning: Used to dynamically fetch and display real-world images of the 
  recommended crops in the UI, enhancing user experience.

3. MACHINE LEARNING MODEL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Model Used: Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
- Pipeline: StandardScaler -> Gaussian Naive Bayes
  
Reasoning for Model Choice:
Gaussian Naive Bayes is a well-suited classification algorithm for this problem 
space. The environmental features (Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium, Temperature, 
Humidity, pH, Rainfall) often follow a continuous distribution. Naive Bayes is 
computationally extremely fast, requires relatively less training data to estimate 
parameters, and scales exceptionally well. The `StandardScaler` ensures all 
features contribute equally to the distance calculations, preventing features 
with larger scales (like Rainfall) from dominating the outcome.

4. DATASET INFORMATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Source Dataset: `Crop Recommendation Dataset`
- Features (Inputs): 
  - Nitrogen (N) 
  - Phosphorous (P) 
  - Potassium (K) 
  - Temperature (°C)
  - Humidity (%)
  - pH Level
  - Rainfall (mm)
- Target (Output): `label` (String representing the crop name, e.g., 'rice', 'maize')
- Classes: 22 distinct crop categories.

Data Preprocessing Strategies Used:
- Outlier Removal: Implemented Interquartile Range (IQR) filtering specifically 
  on numeric columns during the retraining phase (`retrain_smartcrop.py`) to 
  ensure anomalous data points didn't skew the model's accuracy.
- Normalization: Handled by the `StandardScaler` in the `scikit-learn` pipeline.

5. APP FEATURES & CAPABILITIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- User-Friendly Interface: A dynamic, dark-themed UI built with Streamlit.
- Realistic Dropdowns: form dropdowns populated with real-world agricultural 
  ranges (e.g., pH 0-14, Nitrogen 0-300 kg/ha) rather than just the strict bounds 
  of the dataset.
- Real-time Predictions: Instantaneous model inference via the FastAPI backend.
- Multi-lingual Support: Automatically translates the 22 final predicted crop 
  names from English to Hindi (e.g., "Rice - चावल (Chawal)") for better 
  accessibility to native farmers.
- Dynamic Visuals: Integrates the Wikimedia API to scrape and display an image 
  of the predicted crop alongside the recommendation.

6. APPLICATION WORKFLOW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The system prioritizes simplicity by handling UI rendering and Inference locally.

Workflow:
1. The Streamlit UI collects 7 environmental data points from the user.
2. When the user clicks "Predict", Streamlit triggers the local ML Service.
3. The data is parsed and passed into `crop_suggestion_service.py`.
4. The service loads the pre-trained `model.pkl` (GaussianNB pipeline).
5. The data is reshaped into a NumPy array and passed into `model.predict()`.
6. The string result is extracted, formatted with `.title()`, and returned to 
   the main Streamlit script.
7. Streamlit seamlessly applies translations natively via a dictionary map.
8. Streamlit initiates a background `requests.get()` to Wikipedia to dynamically 
   fetch a high-quality visualization of that crop.
9. Streamlit cleanly renders the final Hindi-Translated string and image 
   back to the Recommendation Dashboard.
